    <p>This website is about me. My full name is Marcos Equiza Gasco, and I am currently a third-year Data Science and
         Behavioral Neuroscience student at Northeastern University. I am interested in the intersection of technology 
         and biology (neuroscience more specifically). I would like to pursue a career in the field of computational 
         biology, applying both skillsets to the industry. I have had a co-op experience at Tram.Global, where I worked
         as the Machine Learning Engineer Co-op, implementing statistical models and creating several algorithms and 
         visualizations. To learn more about my career, you can visit my LinkedIn page
